# IO-VNBD
Inertial and Odometry Benchmark Dataset for Ground Vehicle Positioning
Abstract â€“ Low-cost inertial navigation sensors (INS) can be exploited for a reliable tracking solution for autonomous
vehicles. However, position errors grow exponentially due to noises in the measurements. Several deep learning
techniques have been investigated to mitigate the errors for a better navigation solution [1-10]. However, these studies
have involved the use of different datasets not made publicly available. The lack of a robust benchmark dataset has
thus hindered the advancement in the research, comparison and adoption of deep learning techniques for vehicle
positioning based on inertial navigation. In order to facilitate the benchmarking, fast development and evaluation of
positioning algorithms, we therefore present the first of its kind large-scale and information-rich inertial and odometry
focused public dataset called IO-VNBD (Inertial Odometry Vehicle Navigation Benchmark Dataset).The vehicle
tracking dataset was recorded using a research vehicle equipped with ego-motion sensors on public roads in the
United Kingdom, Nigeria, and France. The sensors include a GPS receiver, inertial navigation sensors, wheel-speed
sensors amongst other sensors found on the car as well as the inertial navigation sensors and GPS receiver in an
android smart phone sampling at 10HZ. A diverse number of scenarios and vehicle dynamics are captured such as
traffic, round-abouts, hard-braking etc. on different road types (country roads, motorways etc.) with varying driving
patterns. The dataset consists of a total driving time of about 40 hours over 1,300km for the vehicle extracted data
and about 58 hours over 4,400 km for the smartphone recorded data. We hope that this dataset will prove valuable in
furthering research on the correlation between vehicle dynamics and its displacement as well as other related studies.
